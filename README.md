# Student-Managment-System
The project is a system for managing students in a faculty. The system has two types of accounts, Student and Professor, each of which has different functions and access to data.
Professors, unlike students, can create schedules, set the dates of the season's exams and decide if the students pass the attendance quota of subjects to enter the exam.
Students can register for the season exams, see the dates of the season exams and see the weekly schedule of lectures/seminars.
Both types of profiles have similar functions such as profile data and changing the account password.
The program is written in Java,JDBC is used to communicate with the database and MySQL for query. The GUI is developed in Java SWING.
